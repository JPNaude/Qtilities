INSTALL (Windows)
===============
This guide is to build the latest development branch of Qtilities on Windows (used Windows 7 & XP).

To install Qtilities create a folder that will contain all the libraries used. This location will be reffered to as [YOUR_LIB_PATH]. It is assumed that the Qt SDK is insalled as well as git (see Required Software).

Required Software:
==================
Qt SDK
------
1. Get the latest SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
2. Install Qt SDK

git (optional)
-----------------
git is a fast version management system for distributed development. This installation uses git to get the required source files. 
1. Download git from http://git-scm.com/download
   Download the msysGit binary for windows
2. Install git
   Install the "Git Bash Only" option

GIT Terminal
============
This is the steps needed to set up the git environment
1. Open git bash
2. In the terminal change directory to [YOUR_LIB_PATH]
3. It is also possible to change the start folder in your git bash shortcut in order to open in the right location by default.

Set up dependencies (Optional, disabled by default so you can skip to "Build Qtilities". See Dependencies.pri for more information)
===================
Qtiliites can be build against a few other libraries to extend its functionality. The following will list the dependencies as well as describe how to get them installed.

Qt Property Browser
-------------------
1. Get the qt-solutions Qt Addons from http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-solutions. 
   Run the following command: git clone git://gitorious.org/qt-solutions/qt-solutions.git qt-solutions
2. Build qtpropertybrowser, located inside the newly checked out qt-solutions folder.
   Open the project file located inside the "buildlib" folder of the qtpropertybrowser.
   It is advised to disable the "Shadow build" option in creator. 
   Lib files created should be in the "qtpropertybrowser/lib" folder.

Connection analyzer for Qt
--------------------------
1. Download the conan for qt from http://sourceforge.net/projects/conanforqt/
   To make things a bit easier later on place the conan code in "[YOUR_LIB_PATH]/conanforqt/Conan/". 
2. Build conan.
   It is advised to disable the "Shadow build" option in creator. The lib files should be in the "Conan/lib" folder after a successfull build.
   Build Debug and Release
(note for Conan v1.0.2) When building against latest SDK it can complain that it does not find the qobject_p.h file. Locate the file in your Qt installtion and put absolute path in to get it to build.

Build Qtilities
===============
1. Get the source code from gitorious/
   Run the following command: git clone git://gitorious.org/qtilities/qtilities.git qtilities
2. Open the Qtilities.pro file in QtCreator located in the src folder.
3. Check your project paths:
   Open the "Dependencies.pri" file located in the src folder and check that the paths are set up correctly. 
   QTILITIES_DEPENDENCIES should point to [YOUR_LIB_PATH]. Most probably "$$PWD/../../../".
4. Set up Qtilities build options
   1. If the dependencies was build correctly as described above, open the "Dependencies.pri" file located in the src folder.
   2. Uncomment the following lines if they are not already commented out.
      DEFINES += QTILITIES_PROPERTY_BROWSER
      DEFINES += QTILITIES_CONAN
5. Examples and Plugins
   To build the Qtilities Examples and Plugins the following must be done
   1. Using Qt Creator open the 2 pro files in the "src/Examples" and "src/Plugins" folders.
   2. Go to the Project mode and click on the QtilitiesPlugins tab at the top.
   3. Click on the Dependencies tab just underneath.
   4. Make sure that "Qtilities" is checked in the Dependencies window.
   5. Do the same for the Examples but both "Qtilities" and "QtilitiesPlugins" must be checked in the dependencies window.
6. Qtilities should be able to build now

LIBRARIES
=========
Qtilities will not be able to run if the following steps are not followed. The libraries created by the dependencies as well as Qtilities must be in your Windows PATH. 
1. Add the library locations to your WINDOWS PATH variable
   The following must be added
   [YOUR_LIB_PATH]/Qtilities/bin
   [YOUR_LIB_PATH]/Qtilities/bin/plugins
   [YOUR_LIB_PATH]/conanforqt/Conan/
   [YOUR_LIB_PATH]/qt-solutions/qtpropertybrowser/lib
3. Close Qt Creator and re-open it to make the changes to the PATH variable take effect.
