            \brief Interface which allows objects to broadcast changes made to them.

            Objects can implement this interface if they want to broadcast information when they are modified.

            For example: The project manager will manage project items that implement this interface. When a project item's state changes, it
            will emit its modificationStateChanged() signal which notifies the user that the project changed.
            When the user saves the project, the project manager will call the setModificationState() slot on
            all its project items and all objects in the project tree will have their modification state set to false.

            When you want to connect to the modificationStateChange signal on this interface, connect to it on the object
            returned by objectBase().
