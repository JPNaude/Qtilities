        /*!
          \class AbstractSubjectFilter
          \brief The AbstractSubjectFilter class provides the abstract interface for observer subject filters.

          The AbstractSubjectFilter class defines the standard interface that subject filters must use to be able to interoperate with observers.
          It is not supposed and cannot to be instantiated directly. Instead, you should subclass it to create new subject filters.

          In short, a subject filter is used by an observer to evaulate specific operations performed on subjects by observers. Each
          subject filter needs an observer context which is set using setObserverContext(). Without the observer context set, the filter is not usable.
          When installing subject filters using the Qtilities::Core::Observer::installSubjectFilter() function the observer context
          will automatically be set. On the other hand, Qtilities::Core::Observer::uninstallSubjectFilter() will set the observer
          context to 0.

          For a detailed overview of subject filters, see the \ref subject_filters section of the \ref page_observers article.
