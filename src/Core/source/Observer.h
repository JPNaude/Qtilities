        /*!
        \class Observer
        \brief The observer class is an extended implementation of an observer in the subject-observer pattern.

        The observer class provides a powerful implementation of the subject - observer programming pattern. The observer class is the observer in this implementation (as the name suggests) and any QObject based class can be a subject. One way to think about an observer is to think of it as a context in your application to which certain subjects can be attached or detached. An example of such a context is the observer which manages plugins in the %Qtilities extension system. When plugins are loaded they are attached to this context and become visible in the list of loaded plugins. Another example would be different instances of a scripting engine. When new objects are created inside the scripting engine they exist in that context. It can then for example be possible to have multiple scripting engines within the same application, where different objects belongs to different script engines or are shared between the engines using Observers.

        The example below shows how to create your first observer class and attach objects to it.

\code
// Create the observer:
Observer* observerA = new Observer;

// Create the objects:
QPointer<QObject> object1 = new QObject();
QPointer<QObject> object2 = new QObject();

// Attach objects to observers:
observerA->attachSubject(object1);
observerA->attachSubject(object2);
\endcode

        \section observer_displaying Displaying the context of an Observer

        One of the original goals of the observer implementation was to make it easy, in fact very easy to display the contents of any Observer context. For this purpose the Qtilities::CoreGui::ObserverWidget class was created which allows you to display the contents of an observer context using only a couple lines of code.

        For example:
\code
// Create the observer:
Observer* observerA = new Observer;

// Create the objects:
QPointer<QObject> object1 = new QObject();
QPointer<QObject> object2 = new QObject();

// Attach objects to observers:
observerA->attachSubject(object1);
observerA->attachSubject(object2);

// Display the observer context:
ObserverWidget observerWidget(observerA);
observerWidget.show();
\endcode

        %Observer widgets are very powerful and observers can specify display hints to views that display their contents using the Qtilities::Core::ObserverHints class. This interaction is a topic on its own and the \ref page_observer_widgets page discusses this in detail. Observer widgets supports both Table and Tree views and the Qtilities::CoreGui::TreeNode class is a subclass of observer that makes building of trees using observer easier. The next section describes such trees in more detail.

        \section observer_trees Observer Trees

        Since an observer is able to manage any QObject based class, it is also capable of observing other observers. This feature allows us to build complex hierarchical tree data structures very easily with the only requirements that leaf nodes in our trees must inherit QObject. Using observer widgets you can easily display and tree data structure that you have created and you can even make dot graphs of your tree structures using ObserverDotWriter.

        Lets look at a simple observer tree structure and the functions provided by observer:

        \image html observer_tree_classification.jpg "Observer Trees"

        In the above tree \p Root, \p A and \p B are all observers with \p 1-4 being any QObject based classes. On the \p Root observer it is possible to access its subjects using functions on observer that start with \p subject. For example: subjectCount(), subjectLimit(), subjectAt() etc. Thus these functions allow you to access the objects directly underneath an observer. On the other hand, function starting with \p tree allow you to operate on the complete tree underneath an observer. For example: treeCount(), treeAt() etc.

        %Qtilities provides the SubjectIterator and TreeIterator iterators which allows you to iterate over different parts of the tree structure underneath an observer.

        A common request by Qt developers is the ability to easily create and display data based on arbitrary tree structures to users, and to easily interact with users through these trees. It is of course doable using Qt's QAbstractItemModel but its not a trivial tasks and can take time to get right. %Qtilities attempts to provide an easy solution to this request in the form of ready to use classes which allows you to build trees easily. The \ref page_tree_structures page provides a detailed overview of this solution.

        \section observer_subject_filters Subject filters

    Subject filters are a feature of the observer architecture which allows control over object attachment and detachment, as well as monitoring of properties introduced by the subject filter. For more information on this see the \ref subject_filters section of the \ref page_observers page.

        \section observer_threads Observers and threads

        Since observers manage objects which can live in different threads it is important to take care when using observers outside of the GUI thread. The following considerations must be taken into account when using observers in threads outside of the GUI thread and attaching objects to observers that live in different threads:
        - Observers monitor QDynamicPropertyChange events on objects that it manages, and send QtilitiesPropertyChangeEvent events on specific internal %Qtilities properties to objects that it manages. Since properties cannot be posted to objects living in other threads, and events cannot be filtered on objects in a different thread, this functionality of observers cannot be used when using threads as specified above. Event filtering is enabled by default, thus if you intend to use observers which manage objects in different threads, disable this using toggleSubjectEventFiltering().
        - When using observer's with naming policy filters installed outside of the GUI thread, make sure you don't use the Qtilities::CoreGui::NamingPolicyFilter::PromptUser resolution policy since it will attempt to construct a QWidget under specific circumstances and you application will crash.

        Observer by itself is not thread-safe.

        \section observer_under_the_hood Under The Hood: How observers work behind the scenes.

        From a user perspective the observer API attempts to hide the complexities of how object management is done. Behind the scenes there is a lot that is happening and lots of complex features that allows you to customize the way you use observers. The \ref page_observers article is a good place to start exploring these details.

              When adding/removing many subjects to the observer it makes sense to only let item views know
              that the observer changed when all subjects have been added/removed. This function will disable
              the change notification signals of this observer until endProcessingCycle() is called.

              Note that this function only affects signals emitted by the observer. The observer still monitors
              dynamic property changes on all attached subjects during a processing cycle. To control the
              event filtering, see subjectEventFilteringEnabled() and toggleSubjectEventFiltering().

              If a processing cycle was already started, this function does nothing.

              Internally observers keep track of how many times you start and end processing cycles. To stop a processing cycle you need to call endProcessingCycle() the same number of times you
              called startProcessingCycle(). Thus, you don't need to keep track if a processing cycle was already started in the beginning of your function (you don't have to care about it). For example:

\code
Observer obs;
obs.startProcessingCycle(); // Internal count = 1;
obs.startProcessingCycle(); // Internal count = 2;

// Some function gets the observer without any knowledge of previous start/end processing cycle calls:
// It is not necessary to do the following:
{
    bool is_cycle_active = obs.isProcessingCycleActive();
    obs.startProcessingCycle(); // Internal count = 3;

    // Do some batch processing.
    // If we did not have an internal counter the correct way to end it in a function would be:
    if (!is_cycle_active)
        obs.endProcessingCycle(); // Internal count = 2;

    // However, since there is an internal counter we can ignore the is_cycle_active declaration in the above code and just call:
    obs.endProcessingCycle();
}

obs.endProcessingCycle(); // Internal count = 1;
obs.endProcessingCycle(); // Internal count = 0;
\endcode

              \note It is very important to note that the observer's layoutChanged() and dataChanged() signals are not
              emitted during processing cycles. Thus, views displaying the observer are not going to update
              during processing cycles. When calling endProcessingCycle with the \p broadcast parameter set to true (the default) the
              correct signals will be emitted only if the number of subjects changed during the processing cycle. See endProcessingCycle() for more
              information.

              is true, and not when broadcast is false.

              \param property_name The name of the property which changed.
              \param objects The objects on which the property changed.
