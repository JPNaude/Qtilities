            \brief The ActivityPolicyFilter class is an implementation of AbstractSubjectFilter which allows control over activity of objects within the context of an Observer.

            It is usefull when you need to control the activity of subjects within the context of an observer.

            To install a ActivityPolicyFilter on an Observer is easy:
\code
Observer* obs = new Observer;
ActivityPolicyFilter* activity_filter = new ActivityPolicyFilter;
obs->installSubjectFilter(activity_filter);
\endcode

        When you use Qtilities::CoreGui::TreeNode instead, its even easier:
\code
TreeNode* tree_node = new TreeNode;
ActivityPolicyFilter* activity_filter = tree_node->enableActivityControl(ObserverHints::CheckboxActivityDisplay);
\endcode

              This policy allows developers to implement the functionality where clicking on a node in a tree will
              enable/disabled (check/uncheck) all items underneath the node.

              For an example of this behaviour see the <b>Parent Tracking Activity</b> tab in the \p BuildingTreesExample.

              \note To track the activity of the observer parent, the observer parent must have only one parent itself (othwerise
              it won't be possible to know in which context the activity must be tracked) and the parent must have an activity
              policy filter installed.

              \note In order for the activity property changes to be delivered to this filter, the delivery of QtilitiesPropertyChangeEvents
              must be enabled on the parent observer. See Qtilities::Core::Observer::toggleQtilitiesPropertyChangeEvents().

              \note When minimumActivityPolicy() is set to ProhibitNoneActive, setting the activity to false on the
              observer parent will attempt to disable all objects within this context. However this will be prohibited and
              nothing will change. The opposite, that is setting the activity to true on the observer parent will still work as expected.

              \note When activityPolicy() is set to UniqueActivity, this policy does nothing when set to ParentFollowActivity since
              only one subject can be active at any time.
